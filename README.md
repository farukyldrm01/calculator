# Git - Repository Report

This report outlines the steps taken during the development and version control of a calculator project. The workflow included creating a repository, developing code in iterations, and managing changes effectively using Git. Below is a step-by-step summary.

* Created a remote repository on GitHub.
* Cloned the empty repository to the local machine using 'git clone'.
* Initialized a new project in the selected language (C++) in the local repository folder.
* Committed the empty project to the repository and pushed it to the remote repository.
* Added basic functionality to the calculator  and committed the changes.
* Extended the calculator functionality and committed the changes.
* Further enhanced the code  and committed the changes.
* Reviewed the commit history using 'git log'.
* Experimented with different versions of the code using 'git checkout'.
* Made unsaved changes to the code but reverted them using 'git revert'.
* Pushed all committed changes to the remote repository.
* Deleted the local repository and recloned the project from the remote repository.
* Created a release tag and tested switching between it and the main branch.
* Created a new branch from the main branch and added further development to it.
* Merged the new branch into the main branch after ensuring all changes were correct.
* Shared the repository URL with a friend but restricted access permissions.
* Simulated a conflict, resolved it manually, and pushed the resolution to the remote repository.

This structured approach ensured efficient version control and collaborative development. The use of Git commands facilitated seamless management of code history, branches, and conflict resolution.
